                    <h3>UPDATE 1.01</h3>
                    <h2>A blog post regarding certain future songs</h2>
                    <p>We have some good news and bad news. The good news is this:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We have located several more songs from the session that will be uploaded soon.</li>
                        <li>We are working on improving the website's design and functionality.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The bad news is this:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Due to the controversial nature of some of the content, we may face legal challenges in uploading certain songs.</li>
                        <li>Some songs may take longer to upload than anticipated due to quality issues with the original recordings. This may result in some songs being edited or removed entirely.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We are stating this as some of the artists involved have since cut ties with Ebanks and R. Kelly due to various controversies.
                        We had a case a while ago where one of these artists, specifically the Great Cow Father, had an issue with us uploading one of the few songs he had a feature on due to what Ebanks did the last time he was invited over to his farm.
                        His verse was recorded during the madness of that situation, so he asked us to not upload, or at the very least shorten or edit out his verse from the song as he admitted to nearly raping Ebanks because of how angry he was.
                        We are trying to respect the wishes of all artists involved while still providing as much content as we can.
                        Thank you for understanding. </p>
                    <h3>And without further ado, I'm pleased to announce the following upcoming songs:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>"Farm On The Hill" - The Great Cow Father, featuring Ebanks. The session just so happened to take place the night before the farm incident. Since it's his song and not Ebanks's, Mr. Farmer himself gave us the go ahead to upload it. He intends to include it as a bonus on his next album vinyl for those who buy it in stores within the first month of the vinyl releasing.</li>
                            <li>"ALL FOR THE TAKING" - A gritty trap song by Ebanks, featuring The Great Cow Father as well as a hidden feature who we won't disclose just yet. This song is the one The Great Cow Father wanted us to not upload or at least edit his verse out of or trim. We will provide alternate versions of this song for those who want to hear the original version with his verse included. He also wanted it out because this was intended to be a diss towards a close affiliate of the Great Cow Father, who was angry upon finding out.</li>
                            <li>"08152022 Give Me A Reason" - A heartfelt solo song by Ebanks. This was recorded in the early hours of the morning, approximately 2 AM, 3 and 1/2 hours after R. Kelly had to leave to prepare for his trial.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <h6>P.S. Give Me A Reason wasn't the last song recorded that night, according to another sound engineer involved with the session. Ebanks didn't wrap things up until about 3:30 AM, for some reason. We don't know why he was up so late.</h6>
                    <h6>See you in a few weeks!</h6>

                    <h3>UPDATE 1.02</h3>
                    <h2>"Where's the next couple of songs?"</h2>
                    <p>I decided to address this question since people won't stop spamming my email asking me this exact question, as well as some other questions which I'll get to later.</p>
                    <h4>Initially, the next batch of songs were supposed to come out on New Years Eve or New Years day, but we've had some circumstances preventing us from meeting that deadline:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For starters, the Great Cow Father went back on his word and said we either edit out his verse completely or we just don't upload "ALL FOR THE TAKING", after finding out we were going to give out versions with the full verse anyways.</li>
                        <li>We are currently in a dispute with ebanks regarding "08152022 Give Me A Reason"(we will refer to this as 08152022 for the sake of simplicity). Ebanks wants us to pull that song from the update, because he revealed the song has some very dark confessions that he doesn't want the public knowing about.</li>
                        <li>The hidden feature on "ALL FOR THE TAKING" also reached out to ask for their part to be trimmed or edited out. We are currently working to come to a compromise with them as well.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>So if you couldn't tell by now, dropping some songs that probably won't even make it to streaming services in the first place isn't exactly our most important priority at the moment. We are currently working to come to a compromise to still get these songs out, but no promises.</p>
                    <h2>When will the next songs come out then?</h2>
                    <p>so why are we asking more dumbass questions</p>

                    <h3>UPDATE 1.5</h3>
                    <h2>"Bump & Grind (Ebanks Mix)" IS NOW AVAILABLE</h2>
                    <p>Check out the new version of "Bump & Grind" featuring Ebanks' unique twist!</p>
                    <p>We wanted to give you something while we work on the rest of the songs. Here are some status updates:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To get started, let's talk about "ALL FOR THE TAKING". We are currently working on a compromise with the Great Cow Father to get this song out, but it's proving difficult.</li>
                        <li>After a rather longer than hoped for dispute, Ebanks FINALLY budged and agreed to let us release "Give Me A Reason". However, he asked that we put a warning label on it. You'll see it on the song page.</li>
                        <li>Finally, the hidden feature has decided to let us keep the feature, however they've asked for us to NOT spoil the surprise as to who the feature is. It will remain a mystery for now!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>With that said, we're still working on the rest of the songs and will update you as soon as we have more information.</p>
                    <p>Oh, and before I go, we've dropped a little surprise video in the songs section... see it for yourself.</p>
