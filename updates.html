                    <h2>A blog post regarding certain future songs</h2>
                    <p>We have some good news and bad news. The good news is this:
                        - We have located several more songs from the session that will be uploaded soon.
                        - We are working on improving the website's design and functionality.
                        The bad news is this:
                        - Due to legal reasons, we may not be able to upload all the songs from the session.
                        - Some songs may be edited or altered to comply with policies of artists who are involved.
                        We are stating this as some of the artists involved have since cut ties with Ebanks and R. Kelly due to various controversies.
                        We had a case a while ago where one of these artists, specifically the Great Cow Father, had an issue with us uploading one of the few songs he had a feature on due to what Ebanks did the last time he was invited over to his farm.
                        (for context, Ebanks stole a prized cow of his and ate it the next day. After the Great Cow Father found out, he drove to Ebanks's house to confront him, only to find out Ebanks had already left for parts unknown.)
                        His verse was recorded during the madness of that situation, so he asked us to not upload, or at the very least shorten or edit out his verse from the song.
                        We are trying to respect the wishes of all artists involved while still providing as much content as we can.
